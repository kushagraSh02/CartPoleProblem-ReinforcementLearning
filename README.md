# CartPoleProblem-ReinforcementLearning

Classic inverted pendulum problem which consists of a cart that moves along the horizontal axis and objective is to balance the pole on the cart using python. The goal here is to solve it using controlled trial-and-error, also known as reinforcement learning. 

We use PPO - Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to train AI policies.
